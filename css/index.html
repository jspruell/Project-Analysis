	<h2>Site Intent</h2>
		<p>The intent of this website is to provide a company an interface for customers to request computer repair and services in the Orlando area.  Vista Computer Repair offers plenty of information with the public about their business when it comes to computer repair.  Vista computer repair offers services such as the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Computer Hardware Repair</li>
				<li>Web Design</li>
				<li>Virus Repair and Data Recovery</li>
				<li>Laptop Repair</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Vista Computer Repair is certified by both Microsoft and Dell to complete their computer repairs.  Based on the current state that this website is in, a website re-design is much needed for this website.  There is a lot of unorganized content, and this site seems to be very difficult to navigate through.  Although there is a lot of good content on this site, it is hard to read and difficult to find specific services.  I believe that if this company is to succeed in the industry of web design and computer repair that it would be beneficial that they receive a website re-design.  </p>
